The baseline A320neo jetliner has a choice of two new-generation engines (the PurePower PW1100G-JM from Pratt and Whitney and the LEAP-1A from CFM International) and features large, fuel-saving wingtip devices known as Sharklets.",

We recommend to update this version via our installer before every start of the simulator.\n\n Every addition to the development version is code-reviewed and tested by several people, our QA Team and also interested users. In general it tends to be very stable and robust.\n\n Latest additions to this version can be seen either in the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md) or the commits to the master branch of the project: [Github Commits to Master](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx/commits/master)"

          "WarningContent": "The **experimental version** contains custom systems that more closely matches real-life behaviour of an A320neo.
